**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It includes a mixture of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and packaged software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. AWS offers tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**, is a type of cloud computing service model where software is ready to use without requiring any configuration or installation. SaaS allows users to access applications through a browser connected to the internet. This means that the application can run on a server without the need to install and maintain specific software. The SaaS provider is responsible for operating, managing, and maintaining the software and the infrastructure it runs on. A typical aspect of a SaaS model is pricing that's paid on a subscription or pay-as-you-use model, instead of purchasing all functionality at once in one big chunk.
